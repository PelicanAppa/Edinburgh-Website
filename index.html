        <h1>Why you should visit <em>Edinburgh</em> during <em>Christmastime!</em></h1><br>
        <img src="five.jpg" id="five"> <br>
            <h2>What is Edinburgh?</h2>
            <p>Edingburgh is the capital city of Scotland and is filled with lots of tourists <br>
                and food every year (especially in the winter during Christmastime), like Haggis <br>
                (a Scottish dish consisting of a sheep's or calf's offal mixed with suet, oatmeal, <br>
                and seasoning and boiled in a bag, traditionally one made from the animal's <br>
                stomach), mince and tatties, Scotch pies, etc.
            </p>
            <p>It might not snow much here in the winter but it does get cold so you might <br>
                want to get warm and fuzzy clothes so that you can stay unfrozen.</p>

            <p>There are loads of fun rides like the Twister and others. But the images for <br>
                those are too fast to see so here are some less graphic pictures instead.</p>
                <img src="6.jpg" width="300" height="425" style="border: 10px ridge wheat;"> <img src="7.jpg" width="300" height="425" style="border: 10px ridge wheat;"><br>
                <img src="3.jpg" width="623" height="850" style="border: 10px ridge wheat;">
                <p>The Christmasmarket is always open during the day till the night and has a <br>
                    few rides along with the big Ferris Wheel that you get every year. The <br>
                    queues might be a bit long taking up to 20 minutes but you get a <br>
                    magnificent view of Edinburgh's city centre.</p>

                <p>And from Santa Land, the more fun one in my opinion, you can get good <br>
                    photo sites to take pictures of the castle.</p>
